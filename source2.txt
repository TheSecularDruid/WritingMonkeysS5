a country road a tree
evening
estragon sitting on a low mound is trying to take off his boot he
pulls at it with both hands panting
he gives up exhausted rests tries again
as before
enter vladimir
nothing to be done
i'm beginning
to come round to that opinion all my life i have tried to put it from me
saying vladimir be reasonable you haven't yet tried everything and i
resumed the struggle so there you are again
am i
i'm glad to see you back i thought you were gone forever
me too
together again at last we will have to celebrate this but how get up till i embrace you
not now not now
may one inquire where his highness spent the night
in a ditch
a ditch where
over there
and they didn't beat you
beat me certainly they beat me
the same lot as usual
the same i don't know
when i think of it all these years but for me where
would you be you would be nothing more than a little heap of
bones at the present minute no doubt about it
and what of it
it's too much for one man on the
other hand what's the good of losing heart now that's what i say we should
have thought of it a million years ago in the nineties
ah stop blathering and help me off with this bloody thing
hand in hand from the top of the eiffel tower among the first we were
respectable in those days now it's too late they wouldn't even let us up
what are you doing
taking off my boot did that never happen to you
boots must be taken off every day i'm tired telling you that why
don't you listen to me
help me
it hurts
hurts he wants to know if it hurts
no one ever suffers but you i don't count i would like to hear
what you would say if you had what i have
it hurts
hurts he wants to know if it hurts
you might button it all the same
true never neglect the little things
of life
what do you expect you always wait till the last moment
the last moment hope deferred maketh
the something sick who said that
why don't you help me
sometimes i feel it coming all the same then i go all queer how shall i say relieved and at the same time appalled appalled funny nothing to
be done well
nothing
show me
there's nothing to show
try and put it on again
i will air it for a bit
there's man all over for you blaming on his boots the faults of his
feet this is getting
alarming
one of the thieves was saved it's a reasonable percentage
gogo
what
suppose we repented
repented what
oh we wouldn't have to go into the details
our being born
vladimir breaks into a hearty laugh which he immediately stifles his
hand pressed to his pubis his face contorted
one daren't even laugh any more
dreadful privation
merely smile it's not the same thing nothing to be done
gogo
what is it
did you ever read the bible
the bible i must have taken a look at it
do you remember the gospels
i remember the maps of the holy land coloured they were very pretty
the dead sea was pale blue the very look of it made me thirsty that's
where we will go i used to say that's where we will go for our honeymoon
we will swim we will be happy
you should have been a poet
i was isn't that obvious
silence
where was i how's your foot
swelling visibly
ah yes the two thieves do you remember the story
no
shall i tell it to you
no
it will pass the time two thieves crucified at the same time
as our saviour one
our what
our saviour two thieves one is supposed to have been saved and the
other damned
saved from what
hell
i'm going
he does not move
and yet how is it this is not boring you i hope
how is it that of the four evangelists only one speaks of a thief being
saved the four of them were there or thereabouts and only one speaks of a
thief being saved come on gogo return the ball can't you once
in a while
i find this really most extraordinarily
interesting
one out of four of the other three two don't mention any thieves at
all and the third says that both of them abused him
who
what
what's all this about abused who
the saviour
why
because he wouldn't save them
from hell
imbecile from death
i thought you said hell
from death from death
well what of it
then the two of them must have been damned
and why not
but one of the four says that one of the two was saved
well they don't agree and that's all there is to it
but all four were there and only one speaks of a thief being saved
why believe him rather than the others
who believes him
everybody it's the only version they know
people are bloody ignorant apes
he rises painfully goes limping to extreme left halts gazes into
distance off with his hand screening his eyes turns goes to extreme right
gazes into distance vladimir watches him then goes and picks up the boot
peers into it drops it hastily
pah
he spits estragon moves to center halts with his back to auditorium
charming spot
inspiring prospects let's go
we can't
why not
we are waiting for godot
ah you're sure it was here
what
that we were to wait
he said by the tree do you see any others
what is it
i don't know a willow
where are the leaves
it must be dead
no more weeping
or perhaps it's not the season
looks to me more like a bush
a shrub
a bush
a what are you insinuating that we have come to the wrong place
he should be here
he didn't say for sure he would come
and if he doesn't come
we will come back tomorrow
and then the day after tomorrow
possibly
and so on
the point is
until he comes
you're merciless
we came here yesterday
ah no there you're mistaken
what did we do yesterday
what did we do yesterday
yes
why nothing is certain when you're about
in my opinion we were here
you recognize the place
i didn't say that
well
that makes no difference
all the same that tree that
bog
you're sure it was this evening
what
that we were to wait
he said saturday i think
you think
i must have made a note of it
but what saturday and is it saturday is it not
rather sunday or monday or friday
it's not possible
or thursday
what will we do
if he came yesterday and we weren't here you may be sure he won't come
again today
but you say we were here yesterday
i may be mistaken let's stop talking for a minute do you
mind
all right gogo
gogo gogo
estragon wakes with a start
i was asleep
why will you never let me sleep
i felt lonely
i had a dream
don't tell me
i dreamt that
don't tell me
this one is enough for you
it's not nice of you didi who am i to tell my private nightmares to if i
can't tell them to you
let them remain private you know i can't bear that
there are times when i wonder if it wouldn't be better for us
to part
you wouldn't go far
that would be too bad really too bad wouldn't it didi be
really too bad when you think of the beauty of the way
and the goodness of the wayfarers wouldn't it didi
calm yourself
calm calm the english say cawm
you know the story of the englishman in the brothel
yes
tell it to me
ah stop it
an englishman having drunk a little more than usual proceeds to a
brothel the bawd asks him if he wants a fair one a dark one or a
red-haired one go on
stop it
exit vladimir hurriedly estragon gets up and follows him as far as the
limit of the stage gestures of estragon like those of a spectator
encouraging a pugilist enter vladimir he brushes past estragon crosses
the stage with bowed head estragon takes a step towards him halts
you wanted to speak to me you had something to say to me
didi
i have nothing to say to you
you're angry forgive me

come didi give me your hand embrace me
don't be stubborn you stink of garlic
it's for the kidneys what do we do now
wait
yes but while waiting
what about hanging ourselves
hmm it would give us an erection
an erection
with all that follows where it falls mandrakes grow that's why they
shriek when you pull them up did you not know that
let's hang ourselves immediately
from a bough i wouldn't trust it
we can always try
go ahead
after you
no no you first
why me
you're lighter than i am
just so
i don't understand
use your intelligence can't you
vladimir uses his intelligence
i remain in the dark
this is how it is the bough the bough
use your head can't you
you're my only hope
gogo light bough not break gogo dead didi
heavy bough break didi alone whereas
i hadn't thought of that
if it hangs you it will hang anything
but am i heavier than you
so you tell me i don't know there's an even chance or nearly
well what do we do
don't let's do anything it's safer
let's wait and see what he says
who
godot
good idea
let's wait till we know exactly how we stand
on the other hand it might be better to strike the iron before it
freezes
i'm curious to hear what he has to offer then we will take it or leave
it
what exactly did we ask him for
were you not there
i can't have been listening
oh nothing very definite
a kind of prayer
precisely
a vague supplication
exactly
and what did he reply
that he would see
that he couldn't promise anything
that he would have to think it over
in the quiet of his home
consult his family
his friends
his agents
his correspondents
his books
his bank account
before taking a decision
it's the normal thing
is it not
i think it is
i think so too
silence
and we
i beg your pardon
i said and we
i don't understand
where do we come in
come in
take your time
come in on our hands and knees
as bad as that
your worship wishes to assert his prerogatives
we have no rights any more
laugh of vladimir stifled as before less the smile
you would make me laugh if it wasn't prohibited
we have lost our rights
we got rid of them
silence they remain motionless arms dangling heads sunk sagging at
the knees
we are not tied we are not
listen
they listen grotesquely rigid
i hear nothing
hsst
nor i
sighs of relief they relax and separate
you gave me a fright
i thought it was he
who
godot
pah the wind in the reeds
i could have sworn i heard shouts
and why would he shout
at his horse
silence
i'm hungry
do you want a carrot
is that all there is
i might have some turnips
give me a carrot it's a
turnip
oh pardon i could have sworn it was a carrot all that's turnips
you must have eaten the last wait i have it there dear fellow
make it
last that's the end of them
i asked you a question
ah
did you reply
how's the carrot
it's a carrot
so much the better so much the better what was it you wanted
to know
i have forgotten that's what annoys me i will never forget this
carrot ah yes now i remember
well
we are not tied
i don't hear a word you're saying
i'm asking you if we are tied
tied
tied
how do you mean tied
down
but to whom by whom
to your man
to godot tied to godot what an idea no question of it for
the moment
his name is godot
i think so
fancy that funny the more you eat the worse it gets
with me it's just the opposite
in other words
i get used to the muck as i go along
is that the opposite
question of temperament
of character
nothing you can do about it
no use struggling
one is what one is
no use wriggling
the essential doesn't change
nothing to be done like to finish it
a terrible cry close at hand estragon drops the carrot they remain
motionless then together make a sudden rush towards the wings estragon
stops halfway runs back picks up the carrot stuffs it in his pocket runs
to rejoin vladimir who is waiting for him stops again runs back picks up
his boot runs to rejoin vladimir huddled together shoulders hunched
cringing away from the menace they wait
enter pozzo and lucky pozzo drives lucky by means of a rope passed
round his neck so that lucky is the first to enter followed by the rope
which is long enough to let him reach the middle of the stage before pozzo
appears lucky carries a heavy bag a folding stool a picnic basket and a
greatcoat pozzo a whip
on
back
noise of lucky falling with all his baggage vladimir and estragon turn
towards him half wishing half fearing to go to his assistance vlamdimir
takes a step towards lucky estragon holds him back by the sleeve
let me go
stay where you are
be careful he's wicked
with strangers
is that him
who
er
godot
yes
i present myself pozzo
not at all
he said godot
not at all
you're not mr godot sir
i am pozzo pozzo does that
name mean nothing to you i say does that name mean nothing to
you
vladimir and estragon look at each other questioningly
bozzo bozzo
pozzo pozzo
pppozzzo
ah pozzo let me see pozzo
is it pozzo or bozzo
pozzo no i'm afraid i no i don't seem to
pozzo advances threateningly
i once knew a family called gozzo the mother had the
clap
we are not from these parts sir
you are human beings none the less as far as one can see of the same
species as myself of the same species
as pozzo made in god's image
well you see
who is godot
godot
you took me for godot
oh no sir not for an instant sir
who is he
oh he's a he's a kind of acquaintance
nothing of the kind we hardly know him
true we don't know him very well but all the same
personally i wouldn't even know him if i saw him
you took me for him
that's to say you understand the
dusk the strain waiting i confess i imagined
for a second
waiting so you were waiting for him
well you see
here on my land
we didn't intend any harm
we meant well
the road is free to all
that's how we looked at it
it's a disgrace but there you are
nothing we can do about it
let's say no more about it up pig every time he drops he falls asleep up hog back stop turn
gentlemen i am happy to
have met you yes yes sincerely
happy closer stop
yes the road seems long when one journeys all alone for yes yes six hours that's
right six hours on end and never a soul in sight coat hold that coat touch of autumn in the air this
evening whip yes gentlemen i cannot go for
long without the society of my likes even when the likeness is an imperfect one stool closer
back further
stop that is why with your permission i propose to dally with you a
moment before i venture any further basket the fresh air stimulates the jaded
appetite basket further he stinks happy days
he drinks from the bottle puts it down and begins to eat silence
vladimir and estragon cautiously at first then more boldly begin to
circle about lucky inspecting him up and down pozzo eats his chicken
voraciously throwing away the bones after having sucked them lucky sags
slowly until bag and basket touch the ground then straightens up with a
start and begins to sag again rhythm of one sleeping on his feet
what ails him
he looks tired
why doesn't he put down his bags
how do i know careful
say something to him
look
what
his neck
i see nothing
here
estragon goes over beside vladimir
oh i say
a running sore
it's the rope
it's the rubbing
it's inevitable
it's the knot
it's the chafing
they resume their inspection dwell on the face
he's not bad looking
would you say so
a trifle effeminate
look at the slobber
it's inevitable
look at the slaver
perhaps he's a halfwit
a cretin
looks like a goiter
it's not certain
he's panting
it's inevitable
and his eyes
what about them
goggling out of his head
looks like his last gasp to me
it's not certain ask him a question
would that be a good thing
what do we risk
mister
louder
mister
leave him in peace can't you see he wants
to rest basket
basket what can you
expect it's not his job
ah that's better
please sir
what is it my good man
er you have finished with the er you don't need the
er bones sir
you couldn't have waited
no no he does well to ask do i need the bones no personally i do not need them any more
but
 but in theory the bones go to the carrier he is therefore the one to
ask go on go on don't be
afraid ask him he will tell you
estragon goes towards lucky stops before him
mister excuse me mister
you're being spoken to pig reply try him again
excuse me mister the bones you won't be wanting the bones
lucky looks long at estragon
mister reply do you want them
or don't you they are yours i don't
like it i have never known him to refuse a bone before nice business it would be if he fell sick on me
he puffs at his pipe
it's a scandal
silence flabbergasted estragon stops gnawing looks at pozzo and
vladimir in turn pozzo outwardly calm vladimir embarrassed
are you alluding to anything in particular
to treat a man
 like that i think that no a human being no
it's a scandal
a disgrace
he resumes his gnawing
you are severe what age are you if it's not a rude
question sixty seventy what age would you say
he was
eleven
i am impertinent i
must be getting on thank you for your society unless i
smoke another pipe before i go what do you say oh i'm
only a small smoker a very small smoker i'm not in the habit of smoking
two pipes one on top of the other it makes my
heart go pit-a-pat it's the nicotine one absorbs it in spite of
one's precautions you know how it is but perhaps you
don't smoke yes no it's of no importance but how am i to sit
down now without affectation now that i have risen without appearing to
how shall i say without appearing to falter i beg your
pardon perhaps you didn't speak it's of no
importance let me see
he reflects
ah that's better
he puts the bones in his pocket
let's go
so soon
one moment stool more there
done it
he fills his pipe
let's go
i hope i'm not driving you away wait a little longer you will never
regret it
we are in no hurry
the second is never so sweet as the first i mean but it's sweet just the same
i'm going
he can no longer endure my presence i am perhaps not particularly
human but who cares think twice before you do anything
rash suppose you go now while it is still day for there is no denying it
is still day good what happens in that case i'm out in that case in that
case what happens in that case to your appointment with this
godet godot godin anyhow you see who i mean who has your
future in his hands at least your immediate future
who told you
he speaks to me again if this goes on much longer we will soon be old
friends
why doesn't he put down his bags
i too would be happy to meet him the more people i meet the happier i
become from the meanest creature one departs wiser richer more conscious
of one's blessings even you even you who knows will have
added to my store
why doesn't he put down his bags
but that would surprise me
you're being asked a question
a question who what a moment ago you were calling me
sir in fear and trembling now you're asking me questions no good will
come of this
i think he's listening
what
you can ask him now he's on the alert
ask him what
why he doesn't put down his bags
i wonder
ask him can't you
you want to know why he doesn't put down his bags
as you call them
that's it
you are sure you agree with that
he's puffing like a grampus
the answer is this but stay still i beg of you you're
making me nervous
here
what is it
he's about to speak
estragon goes over beside vladimir motionless side by side they
wait
good is everybody ready is everybody looking at me will you look at me pig
good i am ready is
everybody listening is everybody ready hog i don't like talking in a
vacuum good let me see
he reflects
i'm going
what was it exactly you wanted to know
why he
don't interrupt me if we all speak at once
we will never get anywhere what was i saying what
was i saying
vladimir mimics one carrying a heavy burden pozzo looks at him
puzzled
bags why always hold never put down
why
ah why couldn't you say so before why he doesn't make himself
comfortable let's try and get this clear has he not the right to
certainly he has it follows that he doesn't want to there's reasoning for
you and why doesn't he want to gentlemen the reason is this
make a note of this
he wants to impress me so that i will keep him
what
perhaps i haven't got it quite right he wants to mollify me so that
i will give up the idea of parting with him no that's not exactly it either
you want to get rid of him
he wants to con me but he won't
you want to get rid of him
he imagines that when i see how well he carries i will be tempted to keep
him on in that capacity
you have had enough of him
in reality he carries like a pig it's not his job
you want to get rid of him
he imagines that when i see him indefatigable i will regret my decision
such is his miserable scheme as though i were short of slaves atlas son of jupiter well that's that i
think anything else
vaporizer
you want to get rid of him
remark that i might just as well have been in his shoes and he in mine
if chance had not willed otherwise to each one his due
you waagerrim
i beg your pardon
you want to get rid of him
i do but instead of driving him away as i might have done i mean
instead of simply kicking him out on his arse in the goodness of my heart i
am bringing him to the fair where i hope to get a good price for him the
truth is you can't drive such creatures away the best thing would be to
kill them
lucky weeps
he's crying
old dogs have more dignity
comfort him since you pity him come on wipe away his tears he will feel less forsaken
estragon hesitates
here give it to me i will do it
estragon refuses to give the handkerchief
childish gestures
make haste before he stops hanky
lucky puts down bag and basket picks up handkerchief and gives it to
pozzo goes back to his place picks up bag and basket
oh the swine he's crippled me
i told you he didn't like strangers
show me
he's bleeding
it's a good sign
i will never walk again
i will carry you if necessary
he's stopped crying you have replaced him as it were
the tears of the world are a constant quantity for each one
who begins to weep somewhere else another stops the same is true of the
laugh let us not then speak ill of our generation it is not
any unhappier than its predecessors let us not speak well of it
either let us not speak of it at all it is
true the population has increased
try and walk
estragon takes a few limping steps stops before lucky and spits on
him then goes and sits down on the mound
guess who taught me all these beautiful things my lucky
will night never come
but for him all my thoughts all my feelings would have been of common
things professional worries
beauty grace truth of the first water i knew they were all
beyond me so i took a knook
a knook
that was nearly sixty years ago
yes nearly sixty you wouldn't think it to
look at me would you compared to him i look like a young man no
hat now look did you see
and now you turn him away such an old and faithful servant
swine
pozzo more and more agitated
after having sucked all the good out of him you chuck him away like a
 like a banana skin really
i can't bear it any longer
the way he goes on you have no idea it's terrible he must go
 i'm going mad i can't bear it any longer
silence all look at pozzo
he can't bear it
any longer
he's going mad
it's terrible
how dare you it's abominable such a good master crucify
him like that after so many years really
he used to be so kind so helpful and
entertaining my good angel and now he's killing me
does he want to replace him
what
does he want someone to take his place or not
i don't think so
what
i don't know
ask him
gentlemen i don't know what came over me forgive me forget
all i said i don't remember exactly what it
was but you may be sure there wasn't a word of truth in it do i look like a man that can be made to
suffer frankly what have i done with my
pipe
charming evening we are having
unforgettable
and it's not over
apparently not
it's only beginning
it's awful
worse than the pantomime
the circus
the music-hall
the circus
what can i have done with that briar
he's a scream he's lost his dudeen
laughs noisily
i will be back
he hastens towards the wings
end of the corridor on the left
keep my seat
exit vladimir
i have lost my kapp and peterson
he will be the death of me
you didn't see by any chance oh he's gone
without saying goodbye how could he he might have waited
he would have burst
oh oh well then of course in that case
come here
what for
you will see
you want me to get up
quick look
oh i say
it's all over
enter vladimir somber he shoulders lucky out of his way kicks over
the stool comes and goes agitatedly
he's not pleased
you missed a treat pity
vladimir halts straightens the stool comes and goes calmer
he subsides indeed all subsides a great calm
descends listen pan sleeps
will night never come
all three look at the sky
you don't feel like going until it does
well you see
why it's very natural very natural i myself in your situation if i
had an appointment with a godin godet godot anyhow you
see who i mean i would wait till it was black night before i gave up i would very much like to sit down but i don't quite know how to
go about it
could i be of any help
if you asked me perhaps
what
if you asked me to sit down
would that be a help
i fancy so
here we go be seated sir i beg of you
no no i wouldn't think of it ask me again
come come take a seat i beseech you you will get pneumonia
you really think so
why it's absolutely certain
no doubt you are right done it again thank
you dear fellow but i must really be getting
along if i am to observe my schedule
time has stopped
don't you believe it sir don't you
believe it whatever you like but
not that
everything seems black to him today
except the firmament but i
see what it is you are not from these parts you don't know what our
twilights can do shall i tell you i can't refuse you a
little attention if you please what's the
matter with this whip worn out this whip what was i saying
let's go
but take the weight off your feet i implore you you will catch your
death
true what is your name
adam
ah yes the night but be
a little more attentive for pity's sake otherwise we will never get
anywhere look will you look at the sky pig
good that's enough what is there so extraordinary about it qua sky it is pale and
luminous like any sky at this hour of the day in these latitudes
when the weather is fine an hour ago roughly after having poured forth even since say ten o'clock in the morning tirelessly
torrents of red and white light it begins to lose its effulgence to grow
pale pale ever a little paler
a little paler until pppfff finished it comes to rest but but behind this veil of gentleness and peace night is charging
and will burst upon us pop like that just when we least expect it
that's how it is on this bitch of an earth
long silence
so long as one knows
one can bide one's time
one knows what to expect
no further need to worry
simply wait
we are used to it
he picks up his hat peers inside it shakes it puts it on
how did you find me good
fair middling poor positively bad
oh very good very very good
and you sir
oh tray bong tray tray tray bong
bless you gentlemen bless you i have such need
of encouragement i weakened a little towards the end you didn't
notice
oh perhaps just a teeny weeny little bit
i thought it was intentional
you see my memory is defective
silence
in the meantime nothing happens
you find it tedious
somewhat
and you sir
i have been better entertained
silence pozzo struggles inwardly
gentlemen you have been civil to me
not at all
what an idea
yes yes you have been correct so that i ask myself is there anything
i can do in my turn for these honest fellows who are having such a dull
dull time
even ten francs would be a help
we are not beggars
is there anything i can do that's what i ask myself to cheer them up
i have given them bones i have talked to them about this and that i have
explained the twilight admittedly but is it enough that's what tortures
me is it enough
even five
that's enough
i couldn't accept less
is is enough no doubt but i am liberal it's my nature this evening
so much the worse for me for i
shall suffer no doubt about that what do you
prefer shall we have him dance or sing or recite or think or
who
who you know how to think you two
he thinks
certainly aloud he even used to think very prettily once i could
listen to him for hours now so much the worse for me
well would you like him to think something for us
i would rather he dance it would be more fun
not necessarily
wouldn't it didi be more fun
i would like well to hear him think
perhaps he could dance first and think afterwards if it isn't too much
to ask him
would that be possible
by all means nothing simpler it's the natural order
he laughs briefly
then let him dance
silence
do you hear hog
he never refuses
he refused once dance misery
lucky puts down bag and basket advances towards front turns to pozzo
lucky dances he stops
is that all
encore
lucky executes the same movements stops
pooh i would do as well myself with a
little practice
he used to dance the farandole the fling the brawl the jig the
fandango and even the hornpipe he capered for joy now that's the best he
can do do you know what he calls it
the scapegoat's agony
the hard stool
the net he thinks he's entangled in a net
there's something about it
lucky makes to return to his burdens

during lucky's tirade the others react as follows
vladimir and estragon all attention pozzo dejected and disgusted
vladimir and estragon begin to protest pozzo's sufferings increase
vladimir and estragon attentive again pozzo more and more agitated
and groaning
vladimir and estragon protest violently pozzo jumps up pulls on
the rope general outcry lucky pulls on the rope staggers shouts his
text all three throw themselves on lucky who struggles and shouts his text
given the existence as uttered forth in the public works of puncher and
wattmann of a personal god quaquaquaqua with white beard quaquaquaqua
outside time without extension who from the heights of divine apathia divine
athambia divine aphasia loves us dearly with some exceptions for reasons
unknown but time will tell and suffers like the divine miranda with those
who for reasons unknown but time will tell are plunged in torment plunged in
fire whose fire flames if that continues and who can doubt it will fire the
firmament that is to say blast hell to heaven so blue still and calm so calm
with a calm which even though intermittent is better than nothing but not so
fast and considering what is more that as a result of the labors left
unfinished crowned by the acacacacademy of anthropopopometry of

the labors unfinished of testew and cunnard it is established as hereinafter

yes sir
he steps back hesitates turns and exit running the light suddenly
fails in a moment it is night the moon rises at back mounts in the sky
stands still shedding a pale light on the scene
at last
what are you doing
pale for weariness
eh
of climbing heaven and gazing on the likes of us
your boots what are you doing with your boots
i'm leaving them there
another will come just as as as me but with smaller feet and
they will make him happy
but you can't go barefoot
christ did
christ what has christ got to do with it you're not going to compare
yourself to christ
all my life i have compared myself to him
but where he lived it was warm it was dry
yes and they crucified quick
silence
we have nothing more to do here
nor anywhere else
ah gogo don't go on like that tomorrow everything will be better
how do you make that out
did you not hear what the child said
no
he said that godot was sure to come tomorrow what do you say
to that
then all we have to do is to wait on here
are you mad we must take cover come
on
he draws estragon after him estragon yields then resists they halt
pity we haven't got a bit of rope
come on it's cold
he draws estragon after him as before
remind me to bring a bit of rope tomorrow
yes come on
he draws him after him as before
how long have we been together all the time now
i don't know fifty years maybe
do you remember the day i threw myself into the rhone
we were grape harvesting
you fished me out
that's all dead and buried
my clothes dried in the sun
there's no good harking back on that come on
he draws him after him as before
wait
i'm cold
wait i sometimes wonder if we wouldn't
have been better off alone each one for himself we weren't made for the same road
it's not certain
no nothing is certain
vladimir slowly crosses the stage and sits down beside estragon
we can still part if you think it would be better
it's not worthwhile now
silence
no it's not worthwhile now
silence
well shall we go
yes let's go
they do not move
curtain
next day same time
same place
estragon's boots front center heels together toes splayed
lucky's hat at same place
the tree has four or five leaves
enter vladimir agitatedly he halts and looks long at the tree then
suddenly begins to move feverishly about the stage he halts before the
boots picks one up examines it sniffs it manifests disgust puts it back
carefully comes and goes halts extreme right and gazes into distance off
shading his eyes with his hand comes and goes halts extreme left as
before comes and goes halts suddenly and begins to sing loudly
a dog came in
having begun too high he stops clears his throat resumes
a dog came in the kitchen
and stole a crust of bread
then cook up with a ladle
and beat him till he was dead
then all the dogs came running
and dug the dog a tomb
he stops broods resumes
then all the dogs came running
and dug the dog a tomb
and wrote upon the tombstone
for the eyes of dogs to come
a dog came in the kitchen
and stole a crust of bread
then cook up with a ladle
and beat him till he was dead
then all the dogs came running
and dug the dog a tomb
he stops broods resumes
then all the dogs came running
and dug the dog a tomb
he stops broods softly
and dug the dog a tomb
he remains a moment silent and motionless then begins to move
feverishly about the stage he halts before the tree comes and goes before
the boots comes and goes halts extreme right gazes into distance extreme
left gazes into distance enter estragon right barefoot head bowed he
slowly crosses the stage vladimir turns and sees him
you again come here till i embrace you
don't touch me
vladimir holds back pained
do you want me to go away gogo did they beat you gogo where did you spend the night
don't touch me don't question me don't speak to me stay with me
did i ever leave you
you let me go
look at me will you
look at me
estragon raises his head they look long at each other then suddenly
embrace clapping each other on the back end of the embrace estragon no
longer supported almost falls
what a day
who beat you tell me
another day done with
not yet
for me it's over and done with no matter what happens i
heard you singing
that's right i remember
that finished me i said to myself he's all alone he thinks i'm gone
for ever and he sings
one is not master of one's moods all day i have felt in great form
i didn't get up in the night not once
you see you piss better when i'm not there
i missed you and at the same time i was happy isn't that a
strange thing
happy
perhaps it's not quite the right word
and now
now there you are again there we
are again there i am again
you see you feel worse when i'm with you i feel better alone too
then why do you always come crawling back
i don't know
no but i do it's because you don't know how to defend yourself i
wouldn't have let them beat you
you couldn't have stopped them
why not
there was ten of them
no i mean before they beat you i would have stopped you from doing
whatever it was you were doing
i wasn't doing anything
then why did they beat you
i don't know
ah no gogo the truth is there are things that escape you that don't
escape me you must feel it yourself
i tell you i wasn't doing anything
perhaps you weren't but it's the way of doing it that counts the way
of doing it if you want to go on living
i wasn't doing anything
you must be happy too deep down if you only knew it
happy about what
to be back with me again
would you say so
say you are even if it's not true
what am i to say
say i am happy
i am happy
so am i
so am i
we are happy
we are happy what do we do now now that we are happy
wait for godot things have changed here
since yesterday
and if he doesn't come
we will see when the time comes
i was saying that things have changed here since yesterday
everything oozes
look at the tree
it's never the same pus from one second to the next
the tree look at the tree
estragon looks at the tree
was is not there yesterday
yes of course it was there do you not remember we nearly hanged
ourselves from it but you wouldn't do you not remember
you dreamt it
is it possible you have forgotten already
that's the way i am either i forget immediately or i never forget
and pozzo and lucky have you forgotten them too
pozzo and lucky
he's forgotten everything
i remember a lunatic who kicked the shins off me then he played the
fool
that was lucky
i remember that but when was it
and his keeper do you not remember him
he gave me a bone
that was pozzo
and all that was yesterday you say
yes of course it was yesterday
and here where we are now
where else do you think do you not recognize the place
recognize what is there to recognize all my lousy
life i have crawled about in the mud and you talk to me about scenery
look at this muckheap i have never stirred from
it
calm yourself calm yourself
you and your landscapes tell me about the worms
all the same you can't tell me that this bears any
resemblance to to the macon country for example
you can't deny there's a big difference
the macon country who's talking to you about the macon country
but you were there yourself in the macon country
no i was never in the macon country i have puked my puke of a life away
here i tell you here in the cackon country
but we were there together i could swear to it picking grapes for a
man called can't think of the name of the
man at a place called can't think of the
name of the place do you not remember
it's possible i didn't notice anything
but down there everything is red
i didn't notice anything i tell you
silence vladimir sighs deeply
you're a hard man to get on with gogo
it would be better if we parted
you always say that and you always come crawling back
the best thing would be to kill me like the other
what other what other
like billions of others
to every man his little cross till he dies
and is forgotten
in the meantime let us try and converse calmly since we are incapable
of keeping silent
you're right we are inexhaustible
it's so we won't think
we have that excuse
it's so we won't hear
we have our reasons
all the dead voices
they make a noise like wings
like leaves
like sand
like leaves
silence
they all speak at once
each one to itself
silence
rather they whisper
they rustle
they murmur
they rustle
silence
what do they say
they talk about their lives
to have lived is not enough for them
they have to talk about it
to be dead is not enough for them
it is not sufficient
silence
they make a noise like feathers
like leaves
likes ashes
like leaves
long silence
say something
i'm trying
long silence
say anything at all
what do we do now
wait for godot
ah
silence
this is awful
sing something
no no we could start all over again perhaps
that should be easy
it's the start that's difficult
you can start from anything
yes but you have to decide
true
silence
help me
i'm trying
silence
when you seek you hear
you do
that prevents you from finding
it does
that prevents you from thinking
you think all the same
no no it's impossible
that's the idea let's contradict each another
impossible
you think so
we are in no danger of ever thinking any more
then what are we complaining about
thinking is not the worst
perhaps not but at least there's that
that what
that's the idea let's ask each other questions
what do you mean at least there's that
that much less misery
true
well if we gave thanks for our mercies
what is terrible is to have thought
but did that ever happen to us
where are all these corpses from
these skeletons
tell me that
true
we must have thought a little
at the very beginning
a charnel-house a charnel-house
you don't have to look
you can't help looking
true
try as one may
i beg your pardon
try as one may
we should turn resolutely towards nature
we have tried that
true
oh it's not the worst i know
what
to have thought
obviously
but we could have done without it
que voulez-vous
i beg your pardon
que voulez-vous
ah que voulez-vous exactly
silence
that wasn't such a bad little canter
yes but now we will have to find something else
let me see
he takes off his hat concentrates
let me see ah
they put on their hats relax
well
what was i saying we could go on from there
what were you saying when
at the very beginning
the very beginning of what
this evening i was saying i was saying
i'm not a historian
wait we embraced we were happy happy what do we
do now that we are happy go on waiting waiting let me think
 it's coming go on waiting now that we are happy let
me see ah the tree
the tree
do you not remember
i'm tired
look at it
they look at the tree
i see nothing
but yesterday evening it was all black and bare and now it's covered
with leaves
leaves
in a single night
it must be the spring
but in a single night
i tell you we weren't here yesterday another of your nightmares
and where were we yesterday evening according to you
how would i know in another compartment there's no lack of void
good we weren't here yesterday evening now what
did we do yesterday evening
do
try and remember
do i suppose we blathered
about what
oh this and that i suppose nothing in particular yes now i remember yesterday evening we spent blathering about
nothing in particular that's been going on now for half a century
you don't remember any fact any circumstance
don't torment me didi
the sun the moon do you not remember
they must have been there as usual
you didn't notice anything out of the ordinary
alas
and pozzo and lucky
pozzo
the bones
they were like fishbones
it was pozzo gave them to you
i don't know
and the kick
that's right someone gave me a kick
it was lucky gave it to you
and all that was yesterday
show me your leg
which
both pull up your trousers pull up your trousers
i can't
vladimir pulls up the trousers looks at the leg lets it go estragon
almost falls
the other the other pig there's the wound beginning to fester
and what about it
where are your boots
i must have thrown them away
when
i don't know
why
i don't know why i don't know
no i mean why did you throw them away
because they were hurting me
there they are at the very spot where you left them yesterday
estragon goes towards the boots inspects them closely
they are not mine
not yours
mine were black these are brown
you're sure yours were black
well they were a kind of gray
and these are brown show me
well they are a kind of green
show me well of all the
you see all that's a lot of bloody
ah i see what it is yes i see what's happened
all that's a lot of bloody
it's elementary someone came and took yours and left you his
why
his were too tight for him so he took yours
but mine were too tight
for you not for him
i'm tired let's go
we can't
why not
we are waiting for godot
ah what will we do what will we do
there's nothing we can do
but i can't go on like this
would you like a radish
is that all there is
there are radishes and turnips
are there no carrots
no anyway you overdo it with your carrots
then give me a radish it's black
it's a radish
i only like the pink ones you know that
then you don't want it
i only like the pink ones
then give it back to me
estragon gives it back
i will go and get a carrot
he does not move
this is becoming really insignificant
not enough
silence
what about trying them
i have tried everything
no i mean the boots
would that be a good thing
it would pass the time i assure you it would be an
occupation
a relaxation
a recreation
a relaxation
try
you will help me
i will of course
we don't manage too badly eh didi between the two of us
yes yes come on we will try the left first
we always find something eh didi to give us the impression we exist
yes yes we are magicians but let us persevere in what
we have resolved before we forget come on give me
your foot the other hog higher
try and walk well
it fits
we will try and lace it
no no no laces no laces
you will be sorry let's try the other well
it fits too
they don't hurt you
not yet
then you can keep them
they are too big
perhaps you will have socks some day
true
then you will keep them
that's enough about these boots
yes but
enough i suppose i might as well sit down
he looks for a place to sit down then goes and sits down on the mound
that's where you were sitting yesterday evening
if i could only sleep
yesterday you slept
i will try
he resumes his foetal posture his head between his knees
wait
bye bye bye bye
bye bye
not so loud

bye bye bye bye
bye bye bye bye
bye bye bye bye
bye bye
estragon sleeps vladimir gets up softly takes off his coat and lays
it across estragon's shoulders then starts walking up and down swinging
his arms to keep himself warm estragon wakes with a start jumps up casts
about wildly vladimir runs to him puts his arms around him there

refuses to go any further

they are coming there too
we are surrounded imbecile
there's no way out there there not a soul in sight off you
go quick you won't well i can understand
that wait till i see your only hope left is to disappear
where
behind the tree quick behind the tree
decidedly this tree will not have been the
slightest use to us
i lost my head forgive me it won't happen again tell me
what to do
there's nothing to do
you go and stand there there don't move and watch out
back to back like in the good old days do you see anything
coming
what
do you see anything coming
no
nor i
they resume their watch silence
you must have had a vision
what
you must have had a vision
no need to shout
they resume their watch silence
do you
oh pardon
carry on
no no after you
no no you first
i interrupted you
on the contrary
they glare at each other angrily
ceremonious ape
punctilious pig
finish your phrase i tell you
finish your own
silence they draw closer halt
moron
that's the idea let's abuse each other
they turn move apart turn again and face each other
moron
vermin
abortion
morpion
sewer-rat
curate
cretin
crritic
oh
he wilts vanquished and turns away
now let's make it up
gogo
didi
your hand
take it
come to my arms
yours arms
my breast
off we go
they embrace
they separate silence
how time flies when one has fun
silence
what do we do now
while waiting
while waiting
silence
we could do our exercises
our movements
our elevations
our relaxations
our elongations
our relaxations
to warm us up
to calm us down
off we go
vladimir hops from one foot to the other estragon imitates him
that's enough i'm tired
we are not in shape what about a little deep breathing
i'm tired breathing
you're right let's just do the tree for the balance
the tree
vladimir does the tree staggering about on one leg
your turn
estragon does the tree staggers
do you think god sees me
you must close your eyes
estragon closes his eyes staggers worse
god have
pity on me
and me
on me on me pity on me
enter pozzo and lucky pozzo is blind lucky burdened as before rope
as before but much shorter so that pozzo may follow more easily lucky
wearing a different hat at the sight of vladimir and estragon he stops
short pozzo continuing on his way bumps into him
gogo
what is it who is it
lucky falls drops everything and brings down pozzo with him they lie
helpless among the scattered baggage
is it godot
at last reinforcements at last
help
is it godot
we were beginning to weaken now we are sure to see the evening out
help
do you hear him
we are no longer alone waiting for the night waiting for godot
waiting for waiting all evening we have struggled unassisted now
it's over it's already tomorrow
help
time flows again already the sun will set the moon rise and we away
 from here
pity
poor pozzo
i knew it was him
who
godot
but it's not godot
it's not godot
it's not godot
then who is it
it's pozzo
here here help me up
he can't get up
let's go
we can't
why not
we are waiting for godot
ah
perhaps he has another bone for you
bone
chicken do you not remember
it was him
yes
ask him
perhaps we should help him first
to do what
to get up
he can't get up
he wants to get up
then let him get up
he can't
why not
i don't know
pozzo writhes groans beats the ground with his fists
we should ask him for the bone first then if he refuses we will leave
him there
you mean we have him at our mercy
yes
and that we should subordinate our good offices to certain conditions
what
that seems intelligent all right but there's one thing i'm afraid of
help
what
that lucky might get going all of a sudden then we would be ballocksed
lucky
the one that went for you yesterday
i tell you there was ten of them
no before that the one that kicked you
is he there
as large as life for the moment he is inert
but he might run amuck any minute
help
and suppose we gave him a good beating the two of us
you mean if we fell on him in his sleep
yes
that seems a good idea all right but could we do it is he really
asleep no the best would be to take advantage of pozzo's calling
for help
help
to help him
we help him
in anticipation of some tangible return
and suppose he
let us not waste our time in idle discourse let
us do something while we have the chance it is not every day that we are
needed not indeed that we personally are needed others would meet the case
equally well if not better to all mankind they were addressed those cries
for help still ringing in our ears but at this place at this moment of
time all mankind is us whether we like it or not let us make the most of
it before it is too late let us represent worthily for once the foul brood
to which a cruel fate consigned us what do you say it is true that when with folded arms we weigh the pros and cons
we are no less a credit to our species the tiger bounds to the help of his
congeners without the least reflection or else he slinks away into the
depths of the thickets but that is not the question what are we doing
here that is the question and we are blessed in this that we happen to
know the answer yes in this immense confusion one thing alone is clear we
are waiting for godot to come
ah
help
or for night to fall we have kept our appointment and that's
an end to that we are not saints but we have kept our appointment how
many people can boast as much
billions
you think so
i don't know
you may be right
help
all i know is that the hours are long under these conditions and
constrain us to beguile them with proceedings which how shall i say which
may at first sight seem reasonable until they become a habit you may say
it is to prevent our reason from foundering no doubt but has it not long
been straying in the night without end of the abyssal depths that's what i
sometimes wonder you follow my reasoning
we are all born mad some remain so
help i will pay you
how much
one hundred francs
it's not enough
i wouldn't go so far as that
you think it's enough
no i mean so far as to assert that i was weak in the head when i came
into the world but that is not the question
two hundred
we wait we are bored no don't protest we
are bored to death there's no denying it good a diversion comes along and
what do we do we let it go to waste come let's get to work in an instant all will vanish and
we will be alone once more in the midst of nothingness
he broods
two hundred
we are coming
he tries to pull pozzo to his feet fails tries again stumbles
falls tries to get up fails
what's the matter with you all
help
i'm going
don't leave me they will kill me
where am i
gogo
help
help
i'm going
help me up first then we will go together
you promise
i swear it
and we will never come back
never
we will go to the pyrenees
wherever you like
i have always wanted to wander in the pyrenees
you will wander in them
who farted
pozzo
here here pity
it's revolting
quick give me your hand
i'm going i'm going
well i suppose in the end i will get up by myself in
the fullness of time
what's the matter with you
go to hell
are you staying there
for the time being
come on get up you will catch a chill
don't worry about me
come on didi don't be pig-headed
he stretches out his hand which vladimir makes haste to seize
pull
estragon pulls stumbles falls long silence
help
we have arrived
who are you
we are men
silence
sweet mother earth
can you get up
i don't know
try
not now not now
silence
what happened
will you stop it you pest he can think of nothing but
himself
what about a little snooze
did you hear him he wants to know what happened
don't mind him sleep
silence
pity pity
what is it
were you asleep
i must have been
it's this bastard pozzo at it again
make him stop it kick him in the crotch
will you stop it crablouse
he's off he's down

what do we do now
perhaps i could crawl to him
don't leave me
or i could call to him
yes call to him
pozzo pozzo no reply
together
pozzo pozzo
he moved
are you sure his name is pozzo
mr pozzo come back we won't hurt you
silence
we might try him with other names
i'm afraid he's dying
it would be amusing
what would be amusing
to try him with other names one after the other it would pass the time
and we would be bound to hit on the right one sooner or later
i tell you his name is pozzo
we will soon see abel abel
help
got it in one
i begin to weary of this motif
perhaps the other is called cain cain cain
help
he's all humanity look at the little cloud
where
there in the zenith
well what is there so wonderful about it
silence
let's pass on now to something else do you mind
i was just going to suggest it
but to what
ah
silence
suppose we got up to begin with
no harm trying
they get up
child's play
simple question of will-power
and now
help
let's go
we can't
why not
we are waiting for godot
ah what will we do what will we do
help
what about helping him
what does he want
he wants to get up
then why doesn't he
he wants us to help him get up
then why don't we what are we waiting for
they help pozzo to his feet let him go he falls
we must hold him
feeling better
who are you
do you not recognize us
i am blind
silence
perhaps he can see into the future
since when
i used to have wonderful sight but are you friends
he wants to know if we are friends
no he means friends of his
well
we have proved we are by helping him
exactly would we have helped him if we weren't his friends
possibly
true
don't let's quibble about that now
you are not highwaymen
highwaymen do we look like highwaymen
damn it can't you see the man is blind
damn it so he is so he says
don't leave me
no question of it
for the moment
what time is it
seven o'clock eight o'clock
that depends what time of year it is
is it evening
silence vladimir and estragon scrutinize the sunset
it's rising
impossible
perhaps it's the dawn
don't be a fool it's the west over there
how do you know
is it evening
anyway it hasn't moved
i tell you it's rising
why don't you answer me
give us a chance
it's evening sir it's evening night is drawing nigh
my friend here would have me doubt it and i must confess he shook me for a
moment but it is not for nothing i have lived through this long day and i
can assure you it is very near the end of its repertory how do you
feel now
how much longer are we to cart him around we are not caryatids
you were saying your sight used to be good if i heard you right
wonderful wonderful wonderful sight
silence
expand expand
let him alone can't you see he's thinking of the days when he was
happy memoria praeteritorum bonorum that must be unpleasant
we wouldn't know
and it came on you all of a sudden
quite wonderful
i'm asking you if it came on you all of a sudden
i woke up one fine day as blind as fortune sometimes i wonder
if i'm not still asleep
and when was that
i don't know
but no later than yesterday
don't question me the blind have no notion of time the
things of time are hidden from them too
well just fancy that i could have sworn it was just the opposite
i'm going
where are we
i couldn't tell you
it isn't by any chance the place known as the board
never heard of it
what is it like
it's indescribable it's like nothing there's
nothing there's a tree
then it's not the board
some diversion
where is my menial
he's about somewhere
why doesn't he answer when i call
i don't know he seems to be sleeping perhaps he's dead
what happened exactly
exactly
the two of you slipped and fell
go and see is he hurt
we can't leave you
you needn't both go
you go
after what he did to me never
yes yes let your friend go he stinks so what is he
waiting for
what are you waiting for
i'm waiting for godot
silence
what exactly should he do
well to begin with he should pull on the rope as hard as he likes so
long as he doesn't strangle him he usually responds to that if not he
should give him a taste of his boot in the face and the privates as far as
possible
you see you have nothing to be afraid of it's even an
opportunity to revenge yourself
and if he defends himself
no no he never defends himself
i will come flying to the rescue
don't take your eyes off me
he goes towards lucky
make sure he's alive before you start no point in exerting yourself if
he's dead
he's breathing
then let him have it
with sudden fury estragon starts kicking lucky hurling abuse at him as
he does so but he hurts his foot and moves away limping and groaning
lucky stirs
oh the brute
he sits down on the mound and tries to take off his boot but he soon
desists and disposes himself for sleep his arms on his knees and his head
on his arms
what's gone wrong now
my friend has hurt himself
and lucky
so it is he
what
it is lucky
i don't understand
and you are pozzo
certainly i am pozzo
the same as yesterday
yesterday
we met yesterday do you not remember
i don't remember having met anyone yesterday but tomorrow i won't
remember having met anyone today so don't count on me to enlighten you
but
enough up pig
you were bringing him to the fair to sell him you spoke to us he
danced he thought you had your sight
as you please let me go up
lucky gets up gathers up his burdens
where do you go from here
on whip rope
lucky puts everything down puts end of rope into pozzo's hand takes
up everything again
what is there in the bag
sand on
don't go yet
i'm going
what do you do when you fall far from help
we wait till we can get up then we go on on
before you go tell him to sing
who
lucky
to sing
yes or to think or to recite
but he is dumb
dumb
dumb he can't even groan
dumb since when
have you not done tormenting me with your accursed
time it's abominable when when one day is that not enough for you one
day he went dumb one day i went blind one day we will go deaf one day we
were born one day we shall die the same day the same second is that not
enough for you they give birth astride of a grave the light
gleams an instant then it's night once more on
exeunt pozzo and lucky vladimir follows them to the edge of the stage
looks after them the noise of falling reinforced by mimic of vladimir
announces that they are down again silence vladimir goes towards estragon
contemplates him a moment then shakes him awake
why will you never let me
sleep
i felt lonely
i was dreaming i was happy
that passed the time
i was dreaming that
don't tell me i wonder is he really blind
blind who
pozzo
blind
he told us he was blind
well what about it
it seemed to me he saw us
you dreamt it let's go we can't ah are you sure
it wasn't him
who
godot
but who
pozzo
not at all not at all not at all
i suppose i might as well get up ow didi
i don't know what to think any more
my feet help me
was i sleeping while the others suffered am i sleeping now tomorrow
when i wake or think i do what shall i say of today that with estragon my
friend at this place until the fall of night i waited for godot that
pozzo passed with his carrier and that he spoke to us probably but in
all that what truth will there be
he will know nothing he will tell me about the
blows he received and i will give him a carrot astride of a grave
and a difficult birth down in the hole lingeringly the grave digger puts
on the forceps we have time to grow old the air is full of our cries but habit is a great deadener at me
too someone is looking of me too someone is saying he is sleeping he
knows nothing let him sleep on i can't go on what have
i said
he goes feverishly to and fro halts finally at extreme left broods
enter boy right he halts silence
mister mister albert
off we go again do you not recognize me
no sir
it wasn't you came yesterday
no sir
this is your first time
yes sir
silence

christ have mercy on us
silence
what am i to tell mr godot sir
tell him tell him you saw me and that
 that you saw me you're sure
you saw me you won't come and tell me tomorrow that you never saw me
silence vladimir makes a sudden spring forward the boy avoids him and
exits running silence the sun sets the moon rises vladimir
stands motionless and bowed estragon wakes takes off his boots gets up
with one in each hand and goes and puts them down center front then goes
towards vladimir
what's wrong with you
nothing
i'm going
so am i
was i long asleep
i don't know
silence
where shall we go
not far
oh yes let's go far away from here
we can't
why not
we have to come back tomorrow
what for
to wait for godot
ah he didn't come
no
and now it's too late
yes now it's night
and if we dropped him if we dropped him
he would punish us everything's dead but
the tree
what is it
it's the tree
yes but what kind
i don't know a willow
estragon draws vladimir towards the tree they stand motionless before
it silence
why don't we hang ourselves
with what
you haven't got a bit of rope
no
then we can't
silence
let's go
wait there's my belt
it's too short
you could hang onto my legs
and who would hang onto mine
true
show me all the same it might do in a pinch but is it strong enough
we will soon see here
they each take an end of the cord and pull
it breaks they almost fall
not worth a curse
silence
you say we have to come back tomorrow
yes
then we can bring a good bit of rope
yes
silence
didi
yes
i can't go on like this
that's what you think
if we parted that might be better for us
we will hang ourselves tomorrow unless godot comes
and if he comes
we will be saved
vladimir takes off his hat peers inside it feels about
inside it shakes it knocks on the crown puts it on again
well shall we go
pull on your trousers
what
pull on your trousers
you want me to pull off my trousers
pull on your trousers
true
he pulls up his trousers
well shall we go
yes let's go
they do not move
curtain
